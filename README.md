# Basic-Blog-Developement-using-Python-Django-
This is very basic project of a sample blog developement, with the help of Django framework 

In this project I used Bootstrap-4 for all the front-end work . 
There are basically 3 pages in the project - 
   1 - home  2 - Blog  - 3 - contact us 
All of these are connected to Database . 
To access the Database you need to go to the admin panel by typing  "/admin" in url. 
With the help of admin panel you can pass Dynamic data through Database and render it on Blog .
